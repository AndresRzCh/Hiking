# Hiking

`English`&emsp;[Français](README.md)&emsp;[Español](README_ES.md)


For the hike we realized that it was necessary to juggle several styles of map to have certain information.
This style is based on OsmAnd's Topo style, among other things it improves the readability of the map and a more realistic representation of the terrain.<br><br>


## Notable features compared to the standard topo map style:

- Thicker paths and tracks.
- Difficulty and visibility of the trails
- Useful / interesting POIs highlighted
- Color of land and water occupations
- Natural reserves
- Opaque color for routes based on OSMC symbols
- Additional settings<br><br>
